Given an unsorted array Arr[] of N integers and an integer X, find floor and ceiling of X in Arr[0..N-1].
Floor of X is the largest element which is smaller than or equal to X. Floor of X doesn’t exist if X is smaller than smallest element of Arr[].
Ceil of X is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to X. Ceil of X doesn’t exist if X is greater than greatest element of Arr[].

Code:

pair<int, int> getFloorAndCeil(int arr[], int n, int x) {
    int a=-1,b=-1;
    sort(arr,arr+n);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i]<=x){
            a=arr[i];
        }
        if(arr[i]>=x){
            b=arr[i];
            break;
        }
    }
    return {a,b};
}
