Given a sorted array arr[] of size N without duplicates, and given a value x. 
Floor of x is defined as the largest element K in arr[] such that K is smaller than or equal to x. Find the index of K(0-based indexing).

Code:

 int findFloor(vector<long long> v, long long n, long long x){
        if(x==0)return -1;
        int i;
      for( i=0;i<n;i++){
           if(v[i]>x)
          break;
      }
        return i-1;
    }
