Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.
Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

Approach:

consider the testcase 10 2
numbers that can be formed using above two numbers are 102 and 210. we return 210 as it is the largest number.
one way is to sort the input array by first converting every element of input array into string.
so 10 2 becomes "10" "2"
now sorting them gives "10" "2"(in lexicographical order)
so sorting should be done by comparing the appended result
ex: "102" is smaller than "210" so we return "210".

Code:
//this function enables to sort the array by comparing the appended result.
static bool comp(string a,string b){
         return a+b>b+a;
 }
    string largestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int c=0;
        for(auto x:nums)if(x==0)c++;
        if(c==nums.size())return "0";
        vector<string>v;
        for(auto x:nums){
            v.push_back(to_string(x));
        }
         sort(v.begin(),v.end(),comp);
         string ans="";
         for(auto x:v)ans+=x;
         return ans;
    }
