You are given an array arr[] of N integers including 0. The task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

Approach:

first sort the array.
1. traverse the array and check if element is lessthan or equal to zero.
   since the smallest positive number is needed,skip the negative elements.
   so continue the step.
2. maintain the variable which is intialized to 1 and if element is equal to variable,increment the variable
3. return the variable.

code:

int missingNumber(int arr[], int n) 
    { 
        sort(arr, arr+n);
        int lastMissing=1;
        for(int i=0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(arr[i] <= 0)
            continue;
            if(arr[i] == lastMissing)
            {
                lastMissing++;
            }
        }
        return lastMissing;
    }
