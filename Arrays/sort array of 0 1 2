approach:

1.Initialize the 3 pointers such that low and mid will point to 0th index and high pointer will point to last index
int low = arr[0]

int mid = arr[0]

int high = arr[n – 1]

Now there will 3 different operations / steps based on the value of arr[mid] and will be repeated until mid <= high.

arr[mid] == 0:
swap(arr[low], arr[mid])
low++, mid++

arr[mid] == 1:
mid++

arr[mid] == 2:
swap(arr[mid], arr[high])
high–;
