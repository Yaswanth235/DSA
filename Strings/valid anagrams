Approach:

anagrams are two strings which have same letters.
ex: anagram,nagaram.

approach:
sort two strings and check they are equal or not.if equal,return true.
insert both strings into two hashmaps,if both maps are equal return true.

Code:

bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        sort(t.begin(),t.end());
        if(s==t)return true;
        else return false;
    }
