Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Approach:

consider two strings,i.e, egg and add

  e  g  g 
  a  d  d
  
  above strings are isomorphic because e is mapped to a and g is mapped to d. when g is repeated again, its corresponding letter is d.
  
  approach is to use two maps and map the first occurances of characters.if repeated character is not mapped with original character,return false.
  
  Code:
  
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        int m1[256]={0};
        int m2[256]={0};
       if(s.length()!=t.length())return false;
       for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
           if(!m1[s[i]] && !m2[t[i]]){
               m1[s[i]]=t[i];
               m2[t[i]]=s[i];
           }
           if(m1[s[i]]!=t[i])return false;
       }
       return true; 
    }
};
